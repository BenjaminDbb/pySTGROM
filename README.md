## Abstract
We investigate the scalar-tensor gravity of Damour and Esposito-Far√®se (DEF),
which predicts non-trivial phenomena in the nonperturbative strong-field regime
for neutron stars (NSs). Instead of solving the modified
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, we construct reduced-order surrogate
models, coded in the [pySTGROM](https://github.com/BenjaminDbb/pySTGROM#pystgrom-for-the-def-theory) package, to predict the relations of a NS
radius, mass, and effective scalar coupling to its central density. Our models
are accurate at ~1% level and speed up large-scale calculations by two
orders of magnitude. As an application, we use pySTGROM and Markov-chain
Monte Carlo techniques to constrain parameters in the DEF theory, with five
well-timed binary pulsars, the binary NS (BNS) inspiral GW170817, and a
hypothetical BNS inspiral in the Advanced LIGO and next-generation GW detectors.
In the future, as more binary pulsars and BNS mergers are detected, our
surrogate models will be helpful in constraining strong-field gravity with
essential speed and accuracy.

# pySTGROM (for the DEF theory)

## Packages required

numpy

scipy

h5py

## Usage

The ROMs in the those range:

log10Alpha0 in **[-5.3, -2.5]**

beta0 in **[-4.8, -4.0]**

For now, we have built those ROMs for 9 EOSs. 

EOSs AP3, AP4, ENG, H4, MPA1, PAL1, SLy4, WFF1, and WFF2.

The simply usage:
```python
from stgrom import LoadModel

EOS_name = 'AP4' # EOSs AP3, AP4, ENG, H4, MPA1, PAL1, SLy4, WFF1, and WFF2.

log10Alpha0 = -5.0
beta0 = -4.5

mod4EOS = LoadModel(EOS_name)
mass, radius, alphaA = mod4EOS(log10Alpha0, beta0, mod4EOS.e_cs)
```

## Introduction

This notebook is a companion to the paper posted at [arxiv:1907.00780](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00780). It contains three ROMs for each EOS.

Our paper are based on those papers:

In order to solve the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) eqautions for neutron star, we use the solver for the DEF theory from **Shao:2017gwu** and make it more efficient with parallel computing.
